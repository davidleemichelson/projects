# Compile with:
	$ make

# Notes:
	-Used provided codebase
	-May or may not have used most recent iteration of Board.o (unsure)
	-Submitting everything besides .o files as told
	-Classes defined in .h files BaseAI.h and ScoreAI.h

# Files Submitted and Why:
	-"Everything. In your README, clarify if you used our code or your own." - David Kempe, Piazza
	-"No. We have our own .o files, and yours should result from compiling your own code.
	  We gave you .o files because we want you to be able to use our code, but not see/change the inside of our implementations." - David Kempe, Piazza
